"""Build a lightweight user interest profile from engagement signals.

The profile is a pair of term bags — positive (things you engaged with) and
negative (things you dismissed) — derived from the `signals` and `pinned`
tables. No embeddings: bag-of-words is deterministic, fast, and readable for
audit. When article_embeddings gets populated in the future, `interest_score`
in digest_ranker can transparently swap to vector cosine with the same profile
interface.

Positive-weighted signals, with per-kind horizon + weight:
  - liked      : any time, weight 3.0
  - pinned     : any time, weight 2.0
  - time_read  : last 30d,  weight 1.5  (read for any length)
  - opened     : last 30d,  weight 0.6  (clicked a title; weakest)
  - asked      : last 60d,  weight 1.0  (asked a question about it)

Negative-weighted signals:
  - disliked   : any time, weight 3.0
  - skipped    : last 30d, weight 0.8
  - deleted    : any time, weight 2.0

The profile is rebuilt fresh each digest request — 283 articles × a few
hundred signals is milliseconds.
